`Objective` <br>

The project will stream events generated from a API and create a data pipeline that consumes the real-time data. The data would be processed in real-time and stored to the data lake periodically. The hourly batch job will then consume this data, apply transformations, and create the desired tables for our dashboard to generate analytics.
